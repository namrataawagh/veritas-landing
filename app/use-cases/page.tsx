const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is Veritas a SaaS or a self-hosted product?",
    a: "Self-hosted. You install the Veritas server on a machine inside your network and the agents on your application hosts. Nothing about your data is sent to us. Outside the server, only signed checkpoints go to the witnesses you choose, and they carry hashes rather than personal data.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which personal data does Veritas recognise?",
    a: "Aadhaar numbers (validated with the Verhoeff checksum), PAN, Indian phone numbers, email addresses and card numbers, in logs, API responses and new database columns. You can test any sample line in the Scan Sandbox before deploying.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does Veritas check?",
    a: "Whether personal data appears where it should not, whether it matches what your policy declares for each system, whether it is kept longer than declared, whether fields that identify a person travel together, whether an erased identifier comes back, and whether a current notice covers the data. Each rule is a technical signal, not a legal conclusion.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can an auditor check the evidence without trusting you?",
    a: "Every record is chained to the one before it, and signed checkpoints are kept by witnesses outside the server. The audit pack holds the evidence, the checkpoints, the public key and a stand-alone verifier that runs with no server and no network. It also states plainly what it does not prove.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I deploy Veritas on Kubernetes?",
    a: "Yes. The agent ships with a Kubernetes manifest that runs one agent per node and forwards events to your Veritas server.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does licensing work?",
    a: "Install Veritas, run veritas fingerprint and send us the result. We issue a signed licence file bound to that machine. It is verified locally every time the service starts, with no call home.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Veritas store raw personal data?",
    a: "No. Findings keep masked snippets, the rule that fired, the field, the system and the owning team. Rights lookups and erasure checks use keyed hashes, so the raw identifier is never stored.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Veritas replace our DPO or legal counsel?",
    a: "No. Veritas gives your DPO, your lawyers and your engineering team evidence from the systems themselves. Decisions about the law stay with the people qualified to make them.",
  },
